delete the image from s3 if the user loads the image but doesn't upload it

If A doesn't follow B but you try to use apollo to unfollow B anyway, Prisma throws an error, 
maybe handle that but might not be necessary because users will not be able to unfollow before following first


if you ever decide to change the userRecommendation engine to fit the one shown in the tutorial, watch the user userRecommendation chapter and 
change the userRecommendation extraresolver in user/resolvers in twitter-server


add support for three dots and tweet deletion

remove people you may knowwhen there are no recommended users
